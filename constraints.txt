# Constraints file to prevent build issues in CI/CD
# This file specifies version constraints for packages that should only use binary wheels

# Prevent google-re2 from being built from source - use specific binary version
# If google-re2 is pulled as a dependency, use a version with known binary wheels
google-re2==1.1.20250722; python_version >= "3.8"

# Other packages that commonly have build issues in CI environments
# Ensure we use compatible versions with binary wheels available for Python 3.8
