# Constraints file to prevent build issues in CI/CD
# This file specifies version constraints for packages that should only use binary wheels

# Prevent google-re2 from being built from source - use specific binary version
# If google-re2 is pulled as a dependency, use a version with known binary wheels
google-re2==1.1.20250722; python_version >= "3.8"

# Other packages that commonly have build issues in CI environments
# Ensure we use compatible versions with binary wheels available for Python 3.8
pandas>=1.3.0,<3.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0,<3.0.0
SQLAlchemy>=1.4,<2.0
psycopg2-binary>=2.8.0

# AI/ML packages - prefer stable versions with binary wheels
scikit-learn>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
openai>=1.0.0

# Airflow related constraints - let Airflow manage its own dependencies
apache-airflow==2.7.1
# Removed structlog constraint to avoid conflicts with Airflow dependencies
