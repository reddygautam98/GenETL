# Constraints file to prevent build issues in CI/CD
# This file specifies version constraints for packages that should only use binary wheels

# Prevent google-re2 from being built from source - use specific binary version
# If google-re2 is pulled as a dependency, use a version with known binary wheels

# Other packages that commonly have build issues in CI environments
# Ensure we use compatible versions with binary wheels available for Python 3.8

# AI/ML packages - prefer stable versions with binary wheels

# Airflow related constraints
# constraints.txt is deprecated in this repository.
# The CI now downloads and uses the official Airflow constraints for 2.7.1 (Python 3.8) at runtime.
# If you need to pin additional constraints, update the CI workflow or Dockerfile.ci to include them explicitly.
