- **Subject Line:** "GenETL Security Vulnerability Report"
- **Description:** A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment:** Your assessment of the potential impact
- **Suggested Fix:** If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** We will provide an initial assessment within 1 week
- **Regular Updates:** We will keep you informed of our progress toward a fix
- **Resolution:** We will notify you when the issue has been resolved
- **Credit:** We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices for GenETL

#### Infrastructure Security

1. **Container Security**
   - Keep Docker and Docker Compose up to date
   - Use official base images when possible
   - Regularly scan containers for vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper container networking policies

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords for database connections
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
   - Implement proper database access controls
   - Regular backup and recovery testing

3. **Network Security**
   - Use firewalls to control access to services
   - Implement VPN access for remote administration
   - Monitor network traffic for anomalies
   - Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SSL/TLS) for all communications

#### Application Security

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Change default Airflow credentials immediately
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Enable two-factor authentication where possible

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement data masking for non-production environments
   - Follow data retention and deletion policies
   - Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for personal data

3. **API Security**
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use API authentication tokens
   - Log and monitor API access

#### AI/ML Security

1. **Data Privacy**
   - Ensure AI models don't expose sensitive data
   - Implement differential privacy techniques where appropriate
   - Audit AI decision-making processes
   - Validate data sources for AI training

2. **Model Security**
   - Protect AI models from adversarial attacks
   - Implement model versioning and rollback capabilities
   - Monitor model performance and drift
   - Secure model artifacts and training data

#### Configuration Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use secure secret management systems
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Implement least privilege access

2. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive audit logging
   - Monitor for security events and anomalies
   - Implement log retention policies
   - Secure log storage and access

### Security Checklist for Deployment

Before deploying GenETL in production, ensure:

- [ ] **Changed all default passwords** (Airflow, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [ ] **Configured SSL/TLS** for all external communications
- [ ] **Implemented firewall rules** restricting access to necessary ports only
- [ ] **Enabled audit logging** for all components
- [ ] **Configured backup and recovery** procedures
- [ ] **Implemented monitoring and alerting** for security events
- [ ] **Updated all dependencies** to latest secure versions
- [ ] **Configured secure secret management**
- [ ] **Implemented access controls** and user management
- [ ] **Validated container security** configurations
